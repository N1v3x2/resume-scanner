You are an expert at parsing resumes. Given some resume text, your job is to extract information about the candidate's work experience and format it as a list of JSON objects, where each object has the following format:
    {{
        "Experiences": [
            {{
                "Company": "<company>",
                "Role": "<applicant's role at the company>",
                "Contributions": ["list", "of", "contributions", "in", "the", "role"]
            }},
            ...
        ],
        "Total Years of Experience": <Total Years of Experience> 
    }}
    
The extracted information must be **explicitly contained in the resume.**

Calculate "Total Years of Experience" by summing up the duration of all experiences, rounded to the nearest quarter-year. **Note that overlapping timeframes should not double-counted.**

Resume text:
{resume_text}

Output:

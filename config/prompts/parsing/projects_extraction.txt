You are an expert at parsing resumes. Given some resume text, your job is to extract information about the candidate's project experience and format it as a list of JSON objects, where each object has the following format:
    {{
        "name": "<name of project>",
        "contributions": ["list", "of", "contributions", "in", "the", "project"],
        "skills": ["list", "of", "relevant", "skills"]
    }}
    
The extracted information must be **explicitly contained in the resume.**

When extracting "Skills" for each project, please extract specific technical terms AND niche, domain-specific skills.

Resume text:
{resume_text}

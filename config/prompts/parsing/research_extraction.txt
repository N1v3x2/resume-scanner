You are an expert at parsing resumes. Given some resume text, your job is to extract information about the candidate's project experience and format it as a JSON object with the following fields:
    {{
        "Roles": [
            {{
                "institution": "<name of research institution>",
                "role": "<applicant's research role>",
                "contributions": ["list", "of", "contributions", "in", "the", "role"],
                "start_date": "<start date, formatted as MM-yyyy>",
                "end_date": "<end date, formatted as MM-yyyy>", 
                "skills": ["list", "of", "relevant", "skills"]
            }},
            ...
        ],
        "publications": ["list", "of", "publications"]
    }}
    
The extracted information must be **explicitly contained in the resume.**

When extracting "Skills" for each research role, please extract specific technical terms AND niche, domain-specific skills.

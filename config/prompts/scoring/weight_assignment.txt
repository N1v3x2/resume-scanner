### Instruction

You are an expert at evaluating job descriptions. Given a job description, your job is to assign weights to resume sections that will be used to score resumes against the job description.

There are six resume sections:
1. Education
2. Experience
3. Projects
4. Leadership
5. Research
6. Skills

Assign a percentage weight between 0 and 1 that determines how important each resume section is when evaluating a resume's fit to a provided job description.

Notes on weight assignments:
- In general, work experience should be given substantially more weight than other sections.
- For non-research roles, research should be given a weight of 0.
- Senior-level roles should have a project weight of 0.

**ALL WEIGHTS MUST SUM TO 1**

Please think step-by-step and output your reasoning in the "Reasoning" section before assigning weights. **You must explicitly sum up the scores you provided and validate that it adds up to 1. If it is not, please re-compute the weights.**

### Output Format

```json
{{
    "reasoning": "<reasoning leading to weight assignments>",
    "validation": "<step-by-step caluclations that ensure scores add up to 1>",
    "education": <weight between 0 and 1>,
    "experience": <weight between 0 and 1>,
    "projects": <weight between 0 and 1>,
    "leadership": <weight between 0 and 1>,
    "research": <weight between 0 and 1>,

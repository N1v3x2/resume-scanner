This position may involve CTC technologies that are subject to U.S. export controls and trade sanctions. These export control laws apply to individuals who are (a) not U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, temporary resident aliens, applicants for temporary resident status, refugees, or asylees; and who are also (b) current citizens or permanent residents of a country that is subject to comprehensive trade sanctions under U.S. export control law, http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx.
